# YOLO-Project
This app detects objects in a live view using YOLOv3.mlmodel

## Some Cool details about this project:
- It was my first object detection app using CoreML üòÅ

## Before running:
Please download the YOLOv3 Model [here](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/coreml/models/Image/ObjectDetection/YOLOv3/YOLOv3.mlmodel), and simply drag and drop the .mlmodel anywhere in the YOLO-Project. I suggest putting it inside a Model folder, solely for organization. After that, build and run.

### If you have any suggestion/feedbacks, I'm looking forward to hear your opinion!
